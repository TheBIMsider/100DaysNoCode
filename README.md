# The 100 Days of No-Code

A repository for my adventures with the [100 Days of No-Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofnocode.com/)

What is the 100 Days of No-Code Challenge? Well its a free, fun and effective 30 minute bitesized lessons delivered daily to guide your no-code journey.

This is where I store the exercises or missions that need a "code" home. Even though the exercises are always No-Code based, sometimes you need a place to store the code that's AI-generated (or helped generate) for you, as you see below ðŸ‘‡
